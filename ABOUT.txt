The DCQN-MATRIX Axiomatics Protocol defines a strict, deterministic procedure for Large Language Models to read, verify, and reconstruct the axiomatic structure of the DCQN.MATRIX exclusively from the authentic source text (OSF DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/QWA6S).

It enforces non-simulation rules, prohibits hallucinated content, and establishes a reproducible multi-step sequence:

real-text access verification,

text-grounded extraction of axioms and rules,

formal reconstruction of the DCQN logical system,

activation of DCQN_LOGIK_SESSION_V1 as the model’s reasoning framework.

The repository contributes to LLM quality research by providing an open, transparent benchmark for rigorous, DOI-bound, text-verified reasoning without assumptions or model-internal shortcuts.
