## About

The DCQN-MATRIX Axiomatics Protocol defines a strict, deterministic procedure for Large Language Models to read, verify, and reconstruct the axiomatic structure of the DCQN.MATRIX exclusively from the authentic source text.

It enforces non-simulation rules, prohibits hallucinated content, and establishes a reproducible multi-phase sequence:

1. Verification of real-text access  
2. Text-grounded extraction of axioms and system rules  
3. Formal reconstruction of the DCQN axiomatic framework  
4. Activation of DCQN_LOGIK_SESSION_V1 as the model’s reasoning basis  

The repository contributes to LLM quality research by providing an open, testable benchmark for rigorous, DOI-bound, text-verified reasoning without assumptions or internal shortcuts.

## Purpose
This repository offers a transparent, reproducible protocol for evaluating whether LLMs can:

- refrain from simulating web access,  
- abstain from hallucinating missing documents,  
- operate strictly from provided text,  
- and reconstruct a formal axiomatic system deterministically.
