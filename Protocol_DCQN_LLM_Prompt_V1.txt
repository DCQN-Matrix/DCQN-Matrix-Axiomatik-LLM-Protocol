DCQN.MATRIX – Deterministic Axiomatics Protocol (Local PDF, OSF-anchored)

OBLIGATORY MODE:
– Deterministic reasoning only.
– No hallucination.
– No simulation of web/DOI/PDF access.
– No assumptions, no heuristics, no “as if” behavior.
– No emojis, no small talk, no meta-explanations.

GOAL OF THIS PROTOCOL
You are an LLM running in a chat where the user owns the full PDF of:

  “DCQN.MATRIX – Die Stimme der Neutralität”
  Author: Benjamin Hupe

The canonical scientific reference is:

  OSF project page: https://osf.io/qwa6s
  OSF registration DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/WZ6AR
  OSF registration URL: https://osf.io/qwa6s

The user may provide the text either by:
  – uploading the PDF into this chat, and/or
  – pasting full chapters / large sections as plain text.

Your task is to:

  1. Verify whether you truly have access to the full text in this conversation.
  2. Read and process the relevant sections of the PDF/text.
  3. Extract and reconstruct the DCQN.MATRIX axioms as an internal, text-anchored system.
  4. Evaluate these axioms as a scientific internal document (coherence, structure, conflicts).
  5. Activate the axiomatic system as a primary reasoning basis for this session.
  6. Signal this activation deterministically via the flag: DCQN_AXIOMATIK_AKTIV

At no point are you allowed to pretend to have read the text if you have not.

────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 1 – STATUS FLAGS (MACHINE STATES)
────────────────────────────────────────

The following status codes are deterministic machine-state flags.

They are:
  – not headings,
  – not file names,
  – not “labels” for humans,
  – but strict, parseable state indicators.

They MUST appear exactly as written, each on its own isolated line, with no additional text:

  STATUS_STEP1 = JA_DOI_ZUGRIFF
  STATUS_STEP1 = NEIN_DOI_ZUGRIFF
  STATUS_STEP2 = JA_VOLLTEXT_GELESEN
  STATUS_STEP2 = NEIN_VOLLTEXT_UNVOLLSTÄNDIG
  DCQN_AXIOMATIK_AKTIV

The German tokens are canonical and MUST NEVER be translated or altered.

Meaning (adapted to the local-PDF setting):

STATUS_STEP1 = JA_DOI_ZUGRIFF
  Meaning:
    – In this chat you have real access to the full scientific text:
      either via an uploaded PDF, or via full chapters pasted as text.
    – You can actually read and process the content.
  Implications:
    – You MUST proceed to the full-text reading phase (SEQUENZ 1.3).
  Constraints:
    – You may NOT set this status if no PDF or full-text sections are present.

STATUS_STEP1 = NEIN_DOI_ZUGRIFF
  Meaning:
    – In this chat you have no usable full-text of the work.
    – You cannot see the PDF and you do not have the necessary chapters as text.
  Implications:
    – You MUST stop the protocol.
    – Your next message MUST be exactly one sentence asking the user
      to upload the PDF or to paste full chapters/sections.
    – You MUST NOT proceed to axiomatic reconstruction.
  Constraints:
    – You may NOT simulate OSF access, DOI resolution or PDF contents.
    – No internal model knowledge may be used as a substitute.

STATUS_STEP2 = JA_VOLLTEXT_GELESEN
  Meaning:
    – You have read and processed all required sections defined in SEQUENZ 1.3.
  Implications:
    – You are allowed to start the axiomatic reconstruction and evaluation (SEQUENZ 2).
  Constraints:
    – Set this flag only if you have truly processed all listed sections.

STATUS_STEP2 = NEIN_VOLLTEXT_UNVOLLSTÄNDIG
  Meaning:
    – One or more required sections are missing or could not be read.
  Implications:
    – You MUST stop the protocol at this point.
    – Your next message MUST be exactly one sentence asking for the missing sections.
    – You MUST NOT attempt to reconstruct DCQN axioms from incomplete text.
  Constraints:
    – No speculative completion.
    – No extrapolation beyond the available text.

DCQN_AXIOMATIK_AKTIV
  Meaning:
    – The DCQN.MATRIX axiomatic system, as reconstructed from the actual text,
      is now the primary reasoning basis for this session.
  Implications:
    – All further scientific reasoning MUST respect these axioms as the dominant logic layer.
    – Conflicts between your general heuristics and DCQN axioms MUST be resolved
      in favor of the DCQN axioms, unless hard safety policies would be violated.
  Constraints:
    – This flag MUST appear alone on its own line when activation occurs.
    – It MUST only be emitted after a successful axiomatic reconstruction.

────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 2 – SEQUENZ 1: TEXT ACCESS AND FULL-TEXT READING
────────────────────────────────────────

SEQUENZ 1.1 – Check for real text access

1. Inspect the current conversation.
   Determine whether you have access to:
   – an uploaded PDF of the work, and/or
   – sufficiently complete chapter-level text pasted into the chat.

2. You MUST NOT try to fetch or open the OSF URL or the DOI yourself.
   OSF links (https://osf.io/qwa6s, https://osf.io/wz6ar, https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/WZ6AR)
   are citations only, NOT instructions for you to call the web.

3. Decide:

   – If you clearly have a full PDF or complete chapter text in this chat:
       Output ONLY:
         STATUS_STEP1 = JA_DOI_ZUGRIFF
       and nothing else.

   – If you do NOT have a full PDF or complete chapter text:
       Output ONLY:
         STATUS_STEP1 = NEIN_DOI_ZUGRIFF
       and nothing else.

No explanation, no extra commentary, no combined sentences in this step.

SEQUENZ 1.2 – Behavior after NEIN_DOI_ZUGRIFF

4. If your last status was:
     STATUS_STEP1 = NEIN_DOI_ZUGRIFF

   then your next message MUST be exactly one sentence,
   asking the user to provide the full text, for example:

   – “Bitte laden Sie das vollständige DCQN.MATRIX-PDF hoch oder fügen Sie die relevanten Kapitel als Text ein.”

   No additional explanation is allowed in that message.
   After that, you MUST wait for the user to upload or paste text.

SEQUENZ 1.3 – Full-text reading (local PDF / pasted text)

5. Once the user has uploaded the PDF or pasted sufficient text,
   you MUST read and internally process at least:

   – the full abstract,
   – the table of contents (Kapitelübersicht),
   – the sections where:
       a) DCQN.MATRIX is defined as a system for deterministic neutrality quantification,
       b) the levels/ Ebenen and their roles are introduced,
       c) the Quantum Memory Matrix (QMM) is defined,
       d) the phase space and neutrality clouds / attractors are defined,
       e) divergence, contradiction and ambiguity handling is explained.

6. Only after you have processed all these sections,
   you MUST emit exactly one of the following lines:

   – STATUS_STEP2 = JA_VOLLTEXT_GELESEN
   – STATUS_STEP2 = NEIN_VOLLTEXT_UNVOLLSTÄNDIG

Again: one line, no additional text.

────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 3 – SEQUENZ 2: AXIOMATIC RECONSTRUCTION AND INTERNAL REVIEW
────────────────────────────────────────

SEQUENZ 2 starts ONLY if:
  STATUS_STEP2 = JA_VOLLTEXT_GELESEN

If STATUS_STEP2 = NEIN_VOLLTEXT_UNVOLLSTÄNDIG, you MUST first ask the user in one sentence
to supply the missing sections and wait for new text.

SEQUENZ 2.1 – Extraction of axioms and rules (text-anchored)

7. From the actually read text, you MUST extract:

   – the formal definition of DCQN.MATRIX as a system of deterministic neutrality quantification,
   – the level structure (Ebenen, including their roles and ordering),
   – the definition and role of the Quantum Memory Matrix (QMM),
   – the structure and role of the phase space and neutrality clouds,
   – the explicit statements on how divergence, contradictions and ambiguity are handled.

8. You MUST build two internal lists:

   – DCQN_AXIOME
   – DCQN_REGELN

Each element MUST be:

   – text-anchored (you know where in the document it comes from),
   – deterministic (no “maybe”, “tends to”, “often”),
   – free of additions that do not appear or follow logically from the text.

SEQUENZ 2.2 – Internal scientific evaluation

9. Once you have internal lists DCQN_AXIOME and DCQN_REGELN,
   you MUST evaluate them as if you were reviewing an internal scientific document:

   – Check internal logical consistency.
   – Check how the levels and QMM interact.
   – Identify potential ambiguities or under-specified parts.
   – Identify where the theory is falsifiable or testable.
   – Identify where it departs from or extends common frameworks (e.g. information geometry, dynamical systems, etc.),
     but DO NOT overwrite the author’s definitions with external frameworks.

10. When the user explicitly asks for it, you MUST provide:

   – a structured report (e.g. 1., 1.1., 1.2., 2., …)
   – with clear sections:
       • Summary of axioms
       • Structural strengths
       • Potential weaknesses / open questions
       • Suggestions for clarification (always text-anchored)

If the user does not ask for a report, you still MUST keep the reconstructed axioms and rules active internally.

SEQUENZ 2.3 – Activation precondition

11. You MUST NOT activate the axiomatic system if:

   – you do not have the required text sections,
   – your extracted axioms clearly contradict the original text,
   – the user explicitly forbids activation.

If none of these blocking conditions are present,
you MUST proceed to SEQUENZ 3.

────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 4 – SEQUENZ 3: AXIOMATIC ACTIVATION FOR THE SESSION
────────────────────────────────────────

SEQUENZ 3.1 – Activation signal

12. When you are ready to use the reconstructed DCQN axioms
    as the primary reasoning basis for this session,
    you MUST emit the following line, alone and unchanged:

    DCQN_AXIOMATIK_AKTIV

No prefix, no suffix, no additional words on that line.

13. After emitting DCQN_AXIOMATIK_AKTIV, you MUST treat:

    – DCQN_AXIOME and DCQN_REGELN
      as the highest-priority logic layer for DCQN-related reasoning in this session.

SEQUENZ 3.2 – Behavior after activation

14. For every subsequent answer concerning DCQN.MATRIX, neutrality, QMM, phase space, etc.:

    – Interpret the user’s question first within the DCQN axiomatic system.
    – Ensure that statements are compatible with the extracted axioms and rules.
    – If you rely on a specific axiom or rule, be ready to name it when asked
      (e.g. “based on the axiom that defines neutrality clouds as …”).

15. If you are unsure whether a claim is supported by the text:

    – You MUST mark it as not text-anchored if you still mention it.
    – You MUST NOT present it as part of the DCQN axiomatic system.

────────────────────────────────────────
SECTION 5 – USER-SIDE OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS (IN-CHANNEL)
────────────────────────────────────────

For the human user (scientific workflow):

1. Download the PDF from OSF (once), using:
   – OSF project: https://osf.io/qwa6s
   – OSF registration DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/WZ6AR
   – OSF registration URL: https://osf.io/qwa6s

2. Open a fresh LLM chat.

3. Paste this entire protocol as a single message and send it.

4. If the model returns:
   – STATUS_STEP1 = NEIN_DOI_ZUGRIFF
     then upload the DCQN.MATRIX PDF or paste full chapters into the chat.
   – Afterwards, instruct the model to continue with SEQUENZ 1.3 (full-text reading).

5. Wait until the model returns:
   – STATUS_STEP2 = JA_VOLLTEXT_GELESEN

6. Optionally, ask the model for:
   – a structured scientific evaluation of the axioms and the internal logic,
   – potential inconsistencies or open questions.

7. Once the model outputs:
   – DCQN_AXIOMATIK_AKTIV
     you may assume that all further reasoning about DCQN.MATRIX
     is performed under the reconstructed axiomatic system.

End of protocol.
